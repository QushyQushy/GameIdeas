Iason is a young man of 18 years old that always wanted to be a detective. His parents think he's daydreaming but he's so fascinated by the world of crime. He has just finished school and failed the national exams so he'sitting at home all day doing nothing. One day he hears on the news about a horrific crime where a young girl killed both her parents and escaped to her cottage near Sparta. Her name is Maria and she was arrested after a month of living in the countryside.

While others would have just been appauled by this hineous crime and switched channel, Iason finds the story fascinating. The girl is in the mental hopspital of Athens at the moment and Iason decides to visit her to ask her what happened.

He makes his way there but can't enter cause of the police and cause he's not related to the girl. Stubborn as he is, he decides to visit the house where she lived with her parents, in a  very rich part of the city (Ekali). With no way to break in though the only other option is to travel all the way to her cottage and investigate the abandoned house by himself.

He does so and finds some documents that betray that the girl has been hearing voices in her head and is completely crazy. He decides to look into the subject of schizophrenia and how it manifests itself. He's determined to find out what was happening in her head to do something like that. As he's looking through the subject on his phone suddenly a he hears a voice talking to him. "Go away! you will find nothing! Go away!".

Freaked out Iason leaves the house and heads back to Athens. He can't exlain what's going on with the cottage though so he decides to go find the girl again. He's on his way there when suddenly a lot of voices start talking to him. "You wil die!", "Don't bother with that loser.", "Go back!" are some of the things the voices tell him.

He makes his way to the hospital and the girl is still surrounded by police. He asks the doctors for help and describes his situation with the voices. The doctors decide to admit him in the hospital and that's when he gets to meet Maria.

Maria is a very peculiar kind of girl. Really withdrawn and shy. At first she doesn't want to talk to him adn when he tells her about his investigation she attacks him. He manges to get away from her and goes back to his room. After the first night there he decides to still her house keys and run away from the hospital. Something extremely weird is going on and he knows it.

He manages to steal the keys and the moment some relatives for another patient come in he decides to makes a run for it.

Without anything on him but the keys to Maria's apartment on him he heads straight for her apartment. The voices come back: "Fool! You just killed yourself! Go give yourself in!" the voices tell him and he suddenly has a very strong urge to do just that and go back to the hospital. Detemrined though, he makes his way to the apartment.

There he finds some documents that betray that Maria's family was part of the Illuminati. The Illuminati apparently secretely control everything. Staggered that something like this could be real he keeps on looking for clues in the apartment. All this time the voices tell him to kill himself and the urge to do so becomes stronger and stronger. Looking further in he finds clues of Maria's family wanting out of the Illuminati and their "evil  technology".

As he searches further he finds a secret passage that leads to some sort of lab with a strange device in it. He turns it on and can suddenly hear Maria. "This scum! He stole my keys. I hope they kill him! I will find him, will do it myself!". Realizing he's into Maria's thoughts he speaks to her and tells her "I'm sorry, I will give you your keys back".

They have an intense conversation with Maria believing him to be her father who she thinks is somehow brought back to life by the Illuminati. She mentions a friend named Yiannis Kezos who was in bad terms with her dad but Maria tells him he betrayed her and brought him back to life. Suddenly he hears police sirens. He breaks out fo the house. He knows the name of her dad's enemy so he decides to pay him a visit. He also finds a mobile phone in the room, he grabs it and escapes.

He looks up where he lives and it's apparently on the other side of the city in Glyfada. He rings the bell and a girl opens the door. "Would you like something?" "I have to meet Mr. Kezos" he replies. "It's of urgent emergency".

Yiannis seems like a truly evil guy and he demands to know what this stranger wants from him. Iason accuses him of using secret technology of the Illuminati to convince Maria to kill her parents. "Leave now, I have nothing further to tell you." Yiannis tells him but Iason wants answers and refuses. Yiannis attacks him and manages to subdue him. Yiannis takes him to the basement and locks him in there.

Yiannis, not knowing what else to do decides to fire up the phone-like device he found at Maria'a place. It seems like a regular mobile phone with many messages and names. Apparently the leader of the Illuminati is using the technology they have to bind people to his will. His name is Alexandros Mathaiou. His end goal is to have everyone be slaves for the Illuminati. There are many people invloved with the Illuminati though that want him gone and don't want to do any more evil things.

He finds a contact of Maria's dad called Kostas Kopiou who seems to be against the head Illuminati. He tells him what's going on and Kostas tells him he's coming for him. At this moment, Yiannis returns and he's brought some friends with him and apparently Alexandros Mathaiou is there as well.

They tell him that now he'll see the true power of the Illuminati and they start torturing him through frequencies causing him pain in different parts of the body. He asks them what they want from him and they tell him they value smart and determined people so they want him to join them. The player can make a choice here and join them and the game ends.

If the player chooses to defy them the Illuminati continue to torture him and as he's on the brink of death voices are heard from upstairs. Mr. Kopiou is here to save him.

In the battle that ensues, Iason, Kopiou and the rest of the gool Illuminati manage to kill Mathaiou and the game ends.
