* Open World RPG with Zelda influences.
* Modular Augmentations.
* Graphics (LODs that change) that change according to the main charatcer's abilities and current Karma state.
* Enviromental puzzles that lead to different paths according to what the player chooses to do.
* The player chooses the traits of his best friend (even customizes his appearance if possible) (their best friend will be their love partner in the end) at the beginning of the game with a number of questions (akin to Morrowind) and this friend (male or female) takes different actions according to the player's choices in the game, with multiple potential endings for them.
* Scan Visor.
* Ability for telekinetic powers if you befriend/defeat the appropriate Aes.
* Aes can have any kind of shape or form (they are the strongest feelings and desires of people from before the Third World War).
* Temples and ruins akin to Zelda that are designed with puzzles/riddles (etc.) to gain new abilities.
* Real World Data (like the numbers of endagered animals in the real world) will be used for different events in the game. For example if the number of white tigers decreases some characters in the game vanish for a period of time and come back. If this number increases positive enviromental or stats effects may happen in the game. It will also be used for the personalities of the characters in the game. This will be a thing in all three Reverse Module games.
