* The player can switch between a world where the Aes are in their true form (before the Void World War) and decide their future (saved) form along with enviromental changes on the fly. This will be used so the player can choose what traits they can change for a particular Aes or a particular species of Aes according to their true nature before the Void World War.
* Our love partner will still be with us and will be used for some diversity in the game's quests and rewards.
